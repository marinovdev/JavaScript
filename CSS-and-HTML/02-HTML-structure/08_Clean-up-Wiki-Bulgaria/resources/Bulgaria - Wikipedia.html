<!-- <p><b>Bulgaria</b> <a>/bʌlɡɛərə</a></span><a>listen</a><a>Bulgarian</a>
	: България, <a>romanized</a>:&nbsp;</small><i>Balgariya</i>),
	 officially the <b>Republic of Bulgaria</b> (Bulgarian: Република България, 
	 <small>romanized:&nbsp;</small><i>Republika Balgariya</i>, <small>IPA:&nbsp;</small> 
	 <a>[rɛˈpublikɐ bɐɫˈɡarijɐ]</a></span>), is a country in <a>Southeast Europe</a>. -->
	  It is bordered by <a>Romania</a> to the north, <a>Serbia</a> and <a>North Macedonia</a>
	   to the west, <a>Greece</a> and <a>Turkey</a> to the south, and the <a>Black Sea</a>
		to the east. The capital and largest city is <a>Sofia</a>; other major cities are <a>Plovdiv</a>,
		 <a>Varna</a> and <a>Burgas</a>. With a territory of 110,994 square kilometres (42,855&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi),
		  Bulgaria is Europe's <a>16th-largest country</a>.
</p><p>One of the earliest societies in the lands of modern-day Bulgaria was the <a>Neolithic</a> <a\>Karanovo culture</a>,
	 which dates back to 6,500 BC. In the 6th to 3rd century BC the region was a battleground for <a>Thracians</a>,
	  <a >Persians</a>, <a>Celts</a> and <a>ancient Macedonians</a>; stability came when the 
	  <a>Roman Empire</a> conquered the region in AD 45. The <a>Eastern Roman, or Byzantine, Empire</a> 
	  lost some of these territories to an invading <a>Bulgar</a> horde in the late 7th century.
	   The Bulgars founded the <a>First Bulgarian Empire</a> in AD 681, which dominated most of the 
	   <a>Balkans</a> and significantly influenced <a>Slavic</a> cultures by developing the
		<a>Cyrillic script</a>. This state lasted until the early 11th century, when Byzantine emperor
		 <a>Basil II</a> conquered and dismantled it. A successful Bulgarian revolt in 1185 established a
		  <a>Second Bulgarian Empire</a>, which reached its apex under <a>Ivan Asen II</a>
 (1218–1241). After numerous exhausting wars and feudal strife, the 
Second Bulgarian Empire disintegrated in 1396 and its territories fell 
under <a>Ottoman</a> rule for nearly five centuries.
</p><p>The <a>Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78</a>
 resulted in the formation of the current Third Bulgarian State. Many 
ethnic Bulgarian populations were left outside its borders, which led to
 several conflicts with its neighbours and an alliance with Germany in 
both world wars. In 1946 Bulgaria became a <a>one-party socialist state</a> and part of the Soviet-led 
<a>Eastern Bloc</a>. The ruling <a>Communist Party</a> gave up its monopoly on power after the 
<a>revolutions of 1989</a> and allowed <a>multi-party</a> elections. Bulgaria then transitioned into a 
<a>democracy</a> and a market-based economy.
</p><p>Since adopting a democratic constitution in 1991, the
	 <a>sovereign state</a> has been a <a>unitary</a> <a>parliamentary republic</a>
 with a high degree of political, administrative, and economic 
centralisation. The population of seven million resides mainly in Sofia 
and the capital cities of the <a>27 provinces</a>. The population has declined since the late 1980s.
</p><p>Bulgaria is a member of the <a>European Union</a>,
	 <a>NATO</a>, and the <a>Council of Europe</a>; it is a founding state of the
	  <a>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe</a> (OSCE) and has taken a seat on the
	   <a>UN Security Council</a> three times. Its <a>market economy</a>
		is part of the <a>European Single Market</a> and mostly relies on services, followed by industry—especially
		 machine building and mining—and agriculture.
		  Bulgaria is a <a>developing country</a> and ranks 52nd in the
		   <a>Human Development Index</a>, the lowest development rank in the EU alongside
			<a>Romania</a>. <a>Widespread corruption</a> is a major socioeconomic issue; it ranked as the most corrupt country
			 in the European Union in 2018.<sup><a>[7]</a></sup>
